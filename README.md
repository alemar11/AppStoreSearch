# App Store Search

This is the example project for my blog post on how to replicate the App Store search tab using `UISearchController`. You can read it [here](https://mar.codes/2018-07-17/Replicating-iOS-11-App-Store-search-tab)

I added mock data for 'Instagram' search. All other terms will only display one of the trending topics. 

The example should work in every device but I tested it against a phyical iPhone X. 

This is the final result:
